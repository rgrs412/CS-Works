These are some Bash scripts I wrote for my
"Advanced Programming Tools and Techniques" course at Drexel.

count.bash :
    For each regular file in the working directory, prints the filename, the # of lines, and the # of words to stdout.
    Example output: 
      breadIsDangerous.txt 73 431
      spellExample 5 21

organiseMusic :
    A script that looks in the current directory for mp3 files, then breaks the file name out into artist and song title,
    The file name is in the format: "Ween - Ocean Man.mp3"
    The script creates the appropriate directory(artist name) if it doesn't already exist,
    and removes the artist and the first ' - ' from the file name, and moves it into the directory.

    
reextend :
    A script that accepts two file extensions as command line arguments and
    renames all files with the first extension within the current working directory 
    to have the second extension instead.
    Example command: ./reextend .log .txt
