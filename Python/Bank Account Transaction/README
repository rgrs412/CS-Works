This program was for an assignment in my
"Advanced Programming Tools and Technique" course at Drexel.
We had the option to do the assignment with Bash, Java, Python, etc.

We were to use a log file that contain a list of account transactions (deposits and withdrawals),
to create and give the options to show a specific account's info or transaction history.
There's also an option to insert a transaction to a specific account, which updates the log file.

To run the program:
1) export ACCT_LIST=sample.log (set the environment variable)
2) make                        (the makefile will make accounts.py executable)
3) ./accounts                  (to run the program)

Running "accounts" should give the instructions below:

Execute with the following options:
   -i View Account Information
   -h View Account History
   -t Insert Transaction
   -? Show Usage Message
