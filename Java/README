These are Java project folders that can be opened on
IDEs such as NetBeans or IntelliJ.

For the project folders named "Module/[0-9]/", navigate to the "Assignment" folder.
An example path is "Module1/src/Assignment/".
The "Assignment" folder in each "Module" folder will contain a 
PDF file that will explain the functions of the respective Java programs.
The Java source code file will also include comments that explain the Java program.

For the other Java project folders, navigate to the "src" folder
to find the java source code.
