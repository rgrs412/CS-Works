All requirements for homework 2 part D is completed. Hopefully.

1) 	
	The surveys are saved into the "Surveys" directory after
	saving them through the Menu.

	The "Surveys" directory in the project folder include 1 sample
	survey, "Survey 1", that has one of each type of 
	questions(i.e. True/False, Multiple Choice, Essay, Short Answer, Date, Matching); 
	this also include questions with multiple responses.

	You can load this survey from the menu to display, modify, take, etc.

2) 
	After taking each survey, the response with be stored 
	in the "Survey Responses" directory. 

	There is no "Survey Responses" directory yet,
	you will have to take a survey to have the 
	program generate the directory to store a response.

3) 	
	The tests are saved into the "Tests" directory after
	saving them through the Menu.

	The "Tests" directory in the project folder include 1 sample
	test, "Test 1", that has one of each type of 
	questions(i.e. True/False, Multiple Choice, Essay, Short Answer, Date, Matching); 
	this also include questions with multiple responses.

	You can load this test from the menu to display, modify, take, etc.

4) 	
	After taking each test, the response with be stored 
	in the "Test Responses" directory. 

	There is no "Test Responses" directory yet,
	you will have to take a test to have the 
	program generate the directory to store a response.


Note1:
In addition to the hw instruction of not allowing a user 
to take a survey/test if it's not loaded,
I also added a restriction to not allow
a user to take a survey/test without
saving it. The reason is that there
will be a case where you havn't
saved the survey, but you have
response(s) generated for that unsaved survey;
This may cause problems.

Note2: Delete the "Surveys" and "Tests" directory
to start fresh. The "Surveys" or "Tests" directory
will be generated when the first survey/test is saved.

Note3: The "sampe_questions.txt"
file include the questions I used to 
create "Survey 1" and "Test 1.
